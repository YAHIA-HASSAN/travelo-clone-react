# Travel Booking Website

## 🔸 Who are we?
We are a team of five passionate individuals: **Yahia**, **Mirna**, **Hadir**, **Mostafa**, and myself, **Steven Ibrahim**. Together, we collaborated 🤝 to design and develop a dynamic travel booking website 🌍✈.

## 🔸 What did we build?
We created a user-friendly platform using modern technologies like:

- ⚛ **React.js**: For building an interactive and seamless user interface.
- 📱 **Bootstrap 5**: Ensuring the website is fully responsive on all devices.
- 🖼 **Font Awesome**: Adding beautiful and intuitive icons.
- 🖥 **HTML** and 🎨 **CSS**: Enhancing the visual appeal and user experience.

### Features:
- 🗺 **Browse trips** with detailed itineraries and prices.
- ✍ **Book trips** by providing their name and phone number, with the company following up for confirmation.
- 🔍 **Search for trips** using powerful filters (destination, date, travel mode).
- 💌 **Subscribe** to receive the latest updates and special offers.

## 🔸 How did we work together?
Our workflow was organized based on the **React.js component structure**, with each team member taking ownership of specific components and sections 🧩. This collaborative approach allowed us to efficiently bring everything together into one cohesive project 🤓.

## 🔸 The journey ahead
This project marks the culmination of our journey 🚀 in the **DEPI Scholarship program**.
